# fencer

A two player game.

This is a work-in-progress recreation of the "fencing" event at the 2021 MIT Mystery Hunt.
- The code they used is here: https://github.com/YewLabs/cross-swords.
- There is a video of the event here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqlrJtg-JKg.

There's lots to do still!

The design/layout is bound to change, of course.
